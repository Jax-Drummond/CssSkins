# cssShit

So it is basically my css for websites that I reskin. It is first starting out with a RobloxSkin.

# How To Use

1. You are going to want to get a css editing tool for your browser. For chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha will work.
2. Then you're going to want to find where you can put css code if you're using StyleBot then just go to options 
and change your "Default Editing Mode" to "Edit CSS".
3. Goto the cite that you can use one of my skins on and click on the CSS button and then Open StyleBot or whatever you're using
4. Then you either want to paste "@import url(*instert link that is at the top of all my skins*);" without the quotes. Or go onto whatever skin you're using and click raw, then copy and paste it into your custom css exetenstion

## There will be a video tutorial at some point. If you want to make one it is more then welcome.
